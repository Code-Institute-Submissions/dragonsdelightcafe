[You can view the project here on Github Pages](#)

![Site Screenshot](#)

Dragons Delight is a small cafe and bakery business run in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. They are looking to build a sole online presence through the creation
of a new website where customers will be able to find everything that they need to engage with the business and order food. Their main target audience will continue to
be expats and tourists visiting the city- with a special focus on attracting guests from
The Pestana Riverside Hotel next door to them.

 ## Design 

  - **Colour Scheme:**
        - The colour scheme for the website will be an offshade of white (#fafafa), a dark shade of grey (#323232) 
        and a light brown (#daa520) to bring in the idenity of the business and their colour scheme within the building.
  - **Typography:**
        - The font for the website will be "Noto Sans JP" and the logo font will be "Just Another Hand".

  - **Imagery:**
        - Imagery will be used frequently in the site to catch the users attention and entice them to sample
        some of the great products available. The page will consist of areas with Images as backgrounds,
        and there will also be a Image "Gallery" Section for users to look through. The Gallery will have 12 images,
        and a statement underneathe encouraging users to visit the company Instagram page to boost their presence there.  

## Wireframes

**The site will have one page with 3 sections within it.**

[Desktop/Laptop Wireframe](/docs/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

I decided that the culture of Mobile Users and Desktop users was extremely different. People using mobiles are often
on the move and have less time to scroll through mountains of content. They are also using touch screen devices which
makes scrolling more of a chore. With this in mind I decided to keep the mobile version much simpler with just the 
vitally important information they would need to make an order, or visit the cafe. Users with larger screens tend to 
have a more leisurely approach to visiting a site and obviously a much bigger screen to have more detailed content- 
so it makes sense to give these users a more indepth view of the company and extra encouragement to come along 
and try it for themselves.

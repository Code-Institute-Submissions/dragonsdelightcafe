# Dragons Delight Cafe and Bakery Website

[You can view the project here on Github Pages](#)

![Site Screenshot](#)

Dragons Delight is a small cafe and bakery business run in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. They are looking to build a sole online presence through the creation
of a new website where customers will be able to find everything that they need to engage with the business and order food. Their main target audience will continue to
be expats and tourists visiting the city- with a special focus on attracting guests from
The Pestana Riverside Hotel next door to them.

 ## Design 

  - **Colour Scheme:**
        - The colour scheme for the website will be an offshade of white (#fafafa), a dark shade of grey (#323232) 
        and a light brown (#daa520) to bring in the idenity of the business and their colour scheme within the building.
  - **Typography:**
        - The font for the website will be "Noto Sans JP" and the logo font will be "Just Another Hand".

  - **Imagery:**
        - Imagery will be used frequently in the site to catch the users attention and entice them to sample
        some of the great products available. The page will consist of areas with Images as backgrounds,
        and there will also be a Image "Gallery" Section for users to look through. The Gallery will have 12 images,
        and a statement underneathe encouraging users to visit the company Instagram page to boost their presence there.  

## Wireframes

**The site will have one page with 3 sections within it.**
       
[The Mobile Wireframe](/docs/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

[Desktop/Laptop Wireframe](/docs/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

I decided that the culture of Mobile Users and Desktop users was extremely different. People using mobiles are often
on the move and have less time to scroll through mountains of content. They are also using touch screen devices which
makes scrolling more of a chore. With this in mind I decided to keep the mobile version much simpler with just the 
vitally important information they would need to make an order, or visit the cafe. Users with larger screens tend to 
have a more leisurely approach to visiting a site and obviously a much bigger screen to have more detailed content- 
so it makes sense to give these users a more indepth view of the company and extra encouragement to come along 
and try it for themselves.

## Features
  - Easy navigation through the site with a scroll to the top button on all buttons, 
    and fixed navigation on desktops.
  - Responsive on all devices, including the Samsung Galaxy Fold. Smaller than Bootstrap Breakpoints.
  - Social Media Links, with future further integration planned with Facebook Messenger.
  - Easy Order Now CTA on all devices.  

Technologies Used
====

### **Languages Used:**  

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)  

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/CSS3#:~:text=CSS3%20is%20the%20latest%20evolution,flexible%20box%20or%20grid%20layouts.)

### **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used:** 
1. [Bootstrap 4.0.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/download/)
    - Used throughout the website for responsive components and the grid system.
2. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) 
    - Used to import the 'Just Another Hand' for the site title and certain features and 'Noto Sans JP' fonts to the
      style.css page. Both fonts are used across the entire site.
3. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Used across all sections in the site to catch the users attention and fit with UX 
      conventions of being able to easily identify the meaning of content areas and links from the icons 
      displayed.
4. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for maintaining version control for possible later edits, changes, updates or fixes. 
      The Gitpod terminal was used to commit to Git, and then Git pushed to GitHub.
5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store the project as a repository after being pushed by Git. 
6. [W3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)
    - Used to add extra responsivity and styling to the layout of the cover Image text overlay. 
    I originally planned to include more W3.css animations on the gallery area, but decided to hold back 
    for a later release so the site can visibly grow more over several releases.
7. [EZ Gif](https://ezgif.com/)  
    - Used to edit the width/height of images and decrease their file sizes
   whilst maintining the maximum quality possible.  

   Testing
====
### **Validation** 
The W3C Markup Validator and The W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project
to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project:
